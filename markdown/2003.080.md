##### Circa:
1955

##### Rating:
Exhibit, education, and research quality, illustrating the design concepts, construction and styling of high-pressure, automatic heat, oil burners achieved by the mid 20th century, a period of extraordinarily rapid growth in automatic oil heating in Canada.

##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Type and Design:
The design of the high pressure, 100 psi, oil atomising,  oil burner, represented here in the burner by Fess, would model much of what the industry produced by the 100,000's in the middle years of the 20th century, as the market for automatic oil heat grew exponentially in Canada, made possible, in turn, by the reliable delivery  of stable #2 fuel oils to urban and much of rural Canada 

These burners were largely an assembly of parts with the primary manufacturer providing the engineering and housing on which the component parts were hung on: including, a motor, fan, oil pump, nozzle and firing assembly, with automatic controls provided by another outside vendor
