##### Industrial Significance:
The mid 20th century, prior to the advent of increasingly complex closed-system, hermetic machines, was characterised by relatively simple system technology. It was a period that saw many new manufacturers who were largely assemblers of components provided by other OEM's. This allowed small family companies many the offshoot of Canada's early years of industrialisation, often with modest engineering resources, to move into the refrigeration machine and equipment business.
