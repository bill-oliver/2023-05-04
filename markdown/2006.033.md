##### Description:
An early automatic temperature control for commercial refrigeration
applications, employing a 'silver dollar' style hydraulic power element and extended capillary tube sensor; with line-voltage, four pole open contact switch, mounted in heavy two-piece, screw assembled, cast enclosure with rubber sealing gasket, Tag Snapon,  Circa 1928

One of a set of two controllers, demonstrating variations in design and engineering by the manufacturer, as well as the various effects of natural ageing in use, disuse, abuse and abandonment.

##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Technological Significance:
Representative of one of the broad range of approaches to the engineering, design and construction of temperature controllers being experimented with by 'me too manufactures'. It was a period of rapid growth in what appeared to be an expanding, economically attractive market place  
The heavy, open style, four pole switching marked the controller as able to handle larger HP applications than the mainstream of tilting mercury bulb controllers of the time ' although current and HP ratings are not shown
The unusual attention given here to robust ,water proof [drip proof] construction and other design attributes is symptomatic of the period. It was one in which, in the absence of field-based experience and codified engineering data, manufactures tended, in many ways, to over design. The effects of progressive simplification can be seen in other controllers in the 7.02 series.  
Other significant aspects of the controller include:    
'Silver dollar' style hydraulic power element
original porcelain electrical box connector representative of practice in the period
original wiring harness, using an early form of twin, stranded wire, SJ cable
original two wire black backbite attachment cap
