##### Rating:
Exhibit, education, and research quality, illustrating the engineering design, construction, and operating principles, of a new generation of super compact thermostatic expansion valves, for the period, marketed for a new generation of compact, packaged, mid 20th century commercial refrigeration equipment.

##### Patent Date/Number:
2274127 [1942]

##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 


This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Technological Significance:
In response to the buoyant market for compact TX valve technology a number of manufacturers, including Detroit Lubricator, Mayson, Automatic Products, Sporlan and Danfoss, among others entered the field in the late 1930's and 40's. They produced a remarkable range of design configurations and capacities for different refrigerants and cooling applications - in low temperature, commercial and air conditioning ranges. 
The AP207C was AP's contribution of the times to super compact, ' ton valves.

##### Industrial Significance:
The AP207CWith 60" capillary line and 3/8" bulb, adjustable superheat feature and built in liquid line screen would help to make possible an  explosion of refrigeration and air conditioning applications in the latter part of the 20th century.

##### Socio-economic Significance:
The AP207C, super compact thermostatic expansion valve would help put convenient, reliable and affordable commercial refrigeration and air conditioning equipment in a broad range of small commercial applications from farm to food store and restaurants across Canada. 
As a consequence, the range and quality of foods Canadians would enjoy, year-round was beginning to change and change significantly, even in the pre World War II years.           
The socio-cultural significance of the impact of the unobtrusive, thermostatic  expansion valve on life in Canada, throughout the latter part of the 20th century, would be hard to over-estimate. 
It would become the quintessential, automated refrigerant flow regulating device for most medium and larger commercial refrigeration applications, found in confectioneries, food stores and ware houses. It would help to make possible the wide array of foods and confectionery products Canadians would come to enjoy, as part of the late 20th century Canadian life experience.
