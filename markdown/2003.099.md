##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Notes:
This compressor seems certain to be a product of the ILG Manufacturing Co, although Hull, in his comprehensive text House Hold Refrigeration , 1933 makes no mention of the company's contribution to the field of domestic, refrigeration compressor  manufacturing. Hull focuses instead on its ventilation and air conditioning products. This compressor likely post-dates Hull's work, representing a subsequent business venture by ILG.
