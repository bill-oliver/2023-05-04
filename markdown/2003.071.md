##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to become a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artefact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

Doc # HVACR0601F, 060127
CMX06- 17: Item Description/Significance, Storyline, Date and Place of Origin:   

A replacement shaft seal and 6 bolt retaining plate for Chieftain conventional, belt driven, refrigeration compressors, engineered for 21/32' shaft size, all models beginning in 1937, as popularly found on water coolers cabinet refrigerators and other small commercial refrigeration applications.

The compressor shaft seal was possibly the most critical component in the refrigeration system of the 1920's and 30's, prior to the introduction of hermetic motor compressor technology.

A fragile ground bronze seat running against a ground steel shaft shoulder, with necessary shims, springs and rubber seals was all that kept several pounds of noxious sulphur dioxide out of the kitchens, food stores and restaurants of the nation. Even the slightest scratch across the seal seat would result in refrigerant leakage. 

Notoriously fragile, unreliable, and short lived; their imminent break down represented a constant threat to public health and safety.

Seldom successfully repaired on the job, the replacement compressor shaft seal would quickly become a major 'aftermarket' for the refrigeration industry, with companies such as Rotary marketing several hundreds different replacement seal kits to fit the proliferation of compressor configurations in active use by the 1940's

The engineering inventiveness and the extent of the aftermarket are exemplified by the myriad parents held by Rotary from 1914 through 1939 in countries across the globe, US, Canada, Great Britain, France, Australia, Netherlands, Mexico Brazil and other foreign countries

CMX06- 16: Item Description/Significance, Storyline, Date and Place of Origin:   

Tecumseh valve plate with discharge and suction reed valves and head gaskets for ' HP, belt driven refrigeration compressor - single cylinder, 1 7/16 inch bore and 1 7/16 inch stroke with 2.33 cubic inch displacement.

Such belt driven 'conventional' refrigeration compressor of the early post W.W.II period would be the joy and pride of the industry. A significant engineering design achievement, and a marvel of post war metallurgy, precision manufacturer, they were able to operate at suction pressures down to 20 inches of mercury and at head pressures of 250 to 300 psi. They set a new standard for mid 20th century reliability, maintainability and long live - almost indestructible in normal use. 

Tecumseh would become a leading manufacturer and supplier of open, belt driven, conventional compressors and condensing units to the refrigeration field in Canada.

By the early 1950's, prior to their introduction of hermetically sealed motor compressors, the company  would have over 2, 000,000 conventional compressors in service, in the ' to 15 HP range, sold to the trade through wholesalers and jobbers in Canada and the US
