##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Type and Design:
Frigidaire's movement to progressively higher speed compressors and to full 'V' belt drive seems to be have been a cautious one, taking place over several model years. The Frigidaire model H, still to come, was a new generation of smaller higher speed compressors, but still retained the flat surface fly wheel for V belt operation, see item #045
