##### Industrial Significance:
The open market manufacturers of refrigeration machinery of the period [such as Tecumseh Par and Bruner] would be a critical component of the Canadian refrigeration industry. They would be the direct line of equipment supply to the network of small, independent refrigeration mechanics that emerged by mid century.  

Their products, not tied to dealerships or franchises, would be found in a myriad of small applications such as farm milk cooling, in what was then a largely rural population of small, independent milk producers across Canada.

During this period Par equipment was marketed in Canada through R and E Thermal controls [Railway and Engineering], through their net work of operations across Canada 

The Lynch Corporation, would go on to build a serviceable hermetic motor compressor, with much appeal to the trade, for its serviceability
