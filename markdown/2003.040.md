##### Description:
An early, commercial application, air-cooled, refrigeration machine [condensing unit] by Kelvinator of Canada designed for use with anhydrous, sulphur dioxide. an early refrigerant that made possible, for the first time, small commercial refrigeration applications in food stores etc. The use of low pressure refrigerants, rather than high pressure anhydrous ammonia, opened up a vast commercial market for refrigeration equipment and, in turn, set new expectations by Canadian consumers of what was available at their local grocer and butcher shop, Kelvinator, circa 1932.
