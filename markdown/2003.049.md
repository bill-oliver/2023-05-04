##### Description:
Frigidaire's model AW refrigeration machine exemplifies their engineering approach to what was referred to as 'radiator type' condensing, as it was employed by the company on larger capacity condensing units [See also Model S and G, #046 - #048]. Using sulphur dioxide refrigerant, the Model AW would be seen in Canadian estate homes, institutions, food stores, diary bars and hospitality applications in higher capacity, fractional horsepower applications, well into the 1950's. Then the clear preference of the industry and its publics swung heavily to the use of non-noxious refrigerants, Frigidaire, 1932

##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Type and Design:


##### Construction:


##### Material:


##### Special Features:
The machine is equipped with Frigidaire's floating motor mounting system, a distinctive contribution to the engineering of the period, now by-passed with a rigid mount. The modification stands as historic marker of frequency standardisation in Ontario, circa 1948, when all 25 cycle motors were removed to be replaced by 60 cycle.
