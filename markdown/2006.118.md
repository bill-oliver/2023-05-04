##### Rating:
Exhibit, education, and research quality, illustrating field electrical installation codes and practice, and the steps taken by electric utilities and equipment manufacturers to ally public fears over home electrification ' a necessary prerequisite for the development of a Canadian market place for automatic home heating equipment.

##### Patent Date/Number:
Name copyrighted 1922

##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology. 

This particular safety switch was used on a residential heating system in York County [York Region], North of Toronto during the 1930's.

##### Technological Significance:
The danger of fire and electrocution were matters of wide spread public concern in the 1920's through 30's. Robustly designed equipment, evidence of government certification and equipment testing standards, as well as evidence of competent field practices and craftsmanship were all-important indicators intended to demonstrate due care, caution and respect for public safety.     
Approved field practice, enforced by electrical inspectors, required that such panel boards be installed at the entrance to the furnace or boiler room within easy reach, allowing the homeowner full control and access, in order to shut down the system manually in the case of emergency [see ID#230]. 
The switch provides an example of the use of terminology in the description and specification of safety switches in the early years of home electrification technology. The device is described prominently on the cover as 'single throw fused bottom'.  
Of technological significance, in the history of emerging technology of home electrification , is this 120 volt, fused, disconnect switch designed with a fused neutral - a practice which would be rethought a few years later, and abandoned.

##### Industrial Significance:
The device tells the stories of the widespread apprehension over the coming of home electrification and the steps taken by the underwriters, regulators [codes and practices], electric utilities and equipment manufacturers to ally public fears over home electrification ' and in fact ensure public safety in an embryonic and rapidly developing field where there was little practical experience to draw on.
The embryonic HVACR industry of the times was anxious to work with the electrical equipment manufacturers, regulators and underwriters in publishing re-assuring information on the many benefits and safety of home electrification, as well as educating the tradesmen of the day on electrical codes and safe practices. For these were seen as necessary prerequisites for the sale of automatic home heating equipment.

##### Socio-economic Significance:


##### Socio-cultural Significance:
Featured prominently on the switch, in large black letters on a white panel, an integral part of the design and styling of the switch are the 'code words' intended to ally public fears and instil confidence in public authorities and manufactures concerning the safety of the equipment and practices being followed: 
'Safety Switch'
'Makes Electricity Safe for Everyone'    
Skilful managing of classic 'approach avoidance' psychological effect was major factors in shaping the market place of the day. There was a strong desire to partake of the many benefits of home electrification, which produced a strong psychological force of attraction. As duly demonstrated, the challenge was to reduce the avoidance factor to a manageable level, through a system of verbal cues and assurances.
