##### Description:
An early refrigeration machine, by Frigidaire designed and built for the new chlorinated hydrocarbon refrigerant of the times, 'F12'. A significant, transitional and transformational piece technology, moving from the use of noxious to non-noxious refrigerants, it would serve to vastly increase the market for refrigeration machines and, in turn, their impact on Canadian society and culture. It also serves as a vehicle for telling the stories of the unintended environmental consequences of the move, Frigidaire, circa 1937
