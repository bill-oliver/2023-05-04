##### Description:
Getting those 300 to 400 lb. Cabinet refrigeration machines to the homeowner safely and undamaged was a challenge of its own for the booming Canadian refrigeration industry of the 1930's and 40's. With 3 ply, 3/16' plywood crates, and panels hand nailed to ' x 1 '' framing, bolted to heavy, hard wood pallet, the crates bore large ink stamped, promotional lettering. The crating strategy was intended not only to protect, but also to let neighbours know just what was being un-crated on the porch next door, variously 1936 to 1948:
