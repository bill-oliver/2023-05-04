##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Type and Design:
Static fin coiling produced on a scale not now seen was a feature of the day. Equipped with low side float refrigerant control, a temperamental flow control technology, yet one well developed for the needs of the period., using the same float designs as appeared on Frigidaires ice maker evaporators , see artifact #025, for example

##### Technological Significance:
Refrigerated storage rooms for perishable foods were designed predominantly for high pressure refrigerant, commonly ammonia, in the early years of the 20th century. With the successful entry of lower pressure refrigerants, notably SO2, into the market place, the market was significantly expanded, opening it up to smaller commercial installations, which did not require operating engineers. Food stores, dairies and refrigerated warehouses would welcome the trend. So to the public who would see on the market a whole new range of foods for their health and enjoyment.
