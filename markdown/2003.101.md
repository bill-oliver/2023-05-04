##### Description:
A FRIGIDAIRE, MODEL G, TWIN CYLINDER, ' HP, ULTRA SLOW SPEED COMPRESSOR, 1929: With 16' flywheel, operating at 350 RPM, this compressor, used in large cabinet refrigerators, would stand as a kind of 'metaphor', a shortcut in language, standing for an historic genre of high displacement, slow speed compressors for sulphur dioxide refrigerant, part of the design idiom of the time, dictated by conservative engineering preference, limited know-how, materials and manufacturing methods.

##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Technological Significance:
The slow speed, high displacement, engineering design idiom manifest here stands in sharp contrast to high (medium) speed, low displacement designs emerging about the same time, for example by Kelvinator of Canada, London Ontario. Designed also for sulphur dioxide refrigerant, but with 8 inch flywheels, their engineering would allow them to operate at close to twice the speed, making for much more compact lighter weight refrigeration equipment. See for example items #090 to #093
