##### Description:
A quite remarkable piece of early 20th century styling and engineering of an electrical, room heating appliance by a small, uniquely Ontario, foundry company, branching out into the electric, home equipment business. Canadians, it is said, value their quintessential, winter, fireside, experience above all, So the electric, simulated fireside, with electric heating coils and flickering lights, filtered through amber chunks of glass was seen as a market winner in the early1930's, Renfrew Electric Products, Renfrew Ont, 1935
