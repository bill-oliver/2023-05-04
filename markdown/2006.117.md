This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Technological Significance:
The panel board is an icon of its time, reflecting something of electric trade practices and public expectations for craftsmanship in the early years of the 20th century, an embryonic period in the electrification of Canadian homes and the installation of electric equipment.

##### Industrial Significance:


##### Socio-economic Significance:


##### Socio-cultural Significance:
The attention to styling and detail in the construction of the panel reflected the culture of the day. While relatively crude in construction it reflected the expectation for craftsmanship of the period, including mitred corners, finishing  mouldings and furniture style walnut finish   
A splash of whitewash on the side of the panel is a marker of the household practices of the time. Those that could afford automatic heating were also those that lived in relatively grand homes, invariably with well whitewashed basement walls.
