##### Description:
An early, adjustable, hydraulic bellows actuated control, totally enclosed in 1930's, modern Bakelite housing, senses evaporator surface temperature, Model R, made for Kelvinator, by Ranco, The Automatic Reclosing Circuit Breaker Co. Columbus, Ohio [A.R.C.B. Co], Circa 1931

One of a rare matched set of six Ranco Model R controllers profiling the evolution of this early self-regulating temperature sensing electric motor control device, likely over several years from 1929 through to the early 1930's. The set profiles: 1) the progressive design modifications made to improve performance, 2) design adaptations made as required for different models and styles of Kelvinator cabinet refrigerators, 3) different approaches to user friendly and convenient manual temperature setting by the householder, 4) the application of different mounts and accessories, 4) something of the expected life expectancy of the technology in use, 5) the often precipitous modes of failure, anticipated by the refrigeration service man of the period, and 6) various stages of  physical deterioration, as a result of natural use, misuse and abandonment. See numbers 7.01-3A, B, C, D, E, F. ID # 131 to # 136

##### Group:
7.01 Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Pressure and Temperature Controls - Household

##### Make:
For Kelvinator, by Ranco

##### Manufacturer:
Ranco, The Automatic Reclosing Circuit Breaker Co. Columbus, Ohio [A.R.C.B. Co]

##### Model:
RA-10 [see note #1]

##### Serial No.:
5-31

##### Size:
3' dia. x 7' long

##### Weight:
10oz

##### Circa:
1931

##### Rating:
Exhibit, education, and research quality, illustrating the remarkable engineering advancements made in half a decade by pioneers such as Kelvinator in the design and construction of compact, totally enclosed controls using then modern Bakelite, dielectric material construction.

##### Patent Date/Number:
Stamped date of 5-31

##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Type and Design:

##### Construction:


##### Material:


##### Special Features:
Tinned, steel wire bracket mount 
See Items 7.01-3 B to G for design and application variations involving special features

##### Accessories:


##### Capacities:


##### Performance Characteristics:


##### Operation:
The Model R, like the much larger and earlier Kelvinator Model E, is actuated by a bellows immersed in a freezing solution. Bellows and chamber have now been miniaturised, by comparison with the E, and the chamber fully sealed. 

Also like the Model E, the bellows is charged with sulphur dioxide. As a result the service mechanic was advised to store un-used controls in a shop refrigerator, in order to reduce the strain on the bellows.

##### Technological Significance:
The Model R series thermostat represented a remarkable engineering achievement in 6 or 7 years. A compact design, totally enclosed control, crafted in, then, modern two tone, Bakelite, dielectric material. One third of the size and weight of the Kelvinator E, it was a user friendly, fully adjustable thermostat.

##### Industrial Significance:
The thermostat also marks the early entrance of the Ranco name into the refrigeration and air conditioning temperature control business, supporting the major equipment manufacturers of the period. The Ranco name would survive for many years as a leader in the HVACR control field.

##### Socio-economic Significance:
The streamlined design of the thermostat, executed in polished, two tone, brown and back Bakelite, clearly styled to present a pleasing modern look - a break with the past.
