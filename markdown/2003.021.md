##### Industrial Significance:
This historic relic is, in a sense, representative of the embryonic and earliest development years of any industri3es beginnings. It is here when those with skills, interests, tools and entrepreneurial energy find themselves captivated by the possibilities of the moment, striking out to see what successes are to be had.      

The birth and early years of the Canadian HVACR industry would be characterised by just such adventurers, whether in heating, ventilation, air conditioning or refrigeration.

As carriage makers found themselves imagining themselves in the early years of the automobile business, so metal shops and mechanics would see in the earliest rumblings of  HVACR possibilities and opportunities for new human experience,  personal growth and  development, as well as economic return for their efforts.
