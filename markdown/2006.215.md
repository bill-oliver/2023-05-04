##### Description:
Two inch Micrometer calliper for measuring by thousandths from one inch to two inches, with ratchet stop, knurled handle, and fraction/decimal equivalent chart engraved on yoke in 32nds and 64ths. An example of the precision tools available to Canadian machinists and HVACR mechanics by the 1940's - on which they would be dependent. Used, among other things, to measure the diameter of electric motor bearings, compressor pistons, etc. Beranta, Circa 1942

##### Rating:
Exhibit, education, and research quality, illustrating the finely crafted, precision hand tools on which refrigeration mechanics, involved in repair and rebuilding of HVACR equipment, would come to depend by the middle of the 20th century.

##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to become a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Technological Significance:
This precision micrometer tells many stories of its time: 
The increasing sophistication of the repair,  test and measurement equipment used by HVACR workers by the 1940's ' those involved in repair and rebuilding of equipment
The increasing demands made HVACR mechanics and the accompanying need for precision measuring instruments required for equipment: re-engineering, rebuilding, installation, performance monitoring, trouble-shooting, diagnosis and repair.

##### Industrial Significance:
The instrument is a marker of the vastly changing times in the Canadian refrigeration industry, evident by the 1940's. Many changes were occurring in the industry; the embryonic and early development years of the 1920' and 30's were now history. The industry had new more sophisticated equipment, new refrigerants, and new applications and markets to be served. 
The 1940's and 50's was a period in which much repair and rebuilding took place, especially of open style compressors and electric motors. Small shops evolved to do this work as the opportunity arose. 
By the 1940's -50's the race was on for higher and higher measures of HVACR equipment performance [efficiency quietness, lower temperatures, etc], as well as increasing   reliability, maintainability of equipment ' still desperately crude judged by what would soon follow. Meeting these market demands, expanding the market for equipment would depend on achieving greater precision in manufacture, maintenance and repair ' using new science, new technology, new tools,new procedures, and training in new techniques and practices.
