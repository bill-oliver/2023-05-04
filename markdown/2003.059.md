##### Description:
Applications engineering, like the science and technology it depend on for inspiration, is moved from time to time by creative new ideas, ones that fundamentally alter traditional approaches. The idea of engineering a refrigeration machine in which the compressor is placed on top of the motor, instead of beside it, in order to better fit the space available in a self-contained refrigerated fixture, is just such an inspirational idea, here by a small Ontario company in its distinctive orange, Robert Elder Ltd. Toronto, 1956
