##### Rating:
Exhibit, education, and research quality, illustrating the engineering design, construction and operating principles of an early 2 temperature suction pressure regulating valve, designed for soda fountain applications

##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Technological Significance:
For cost considerations, especially in the era of open refrigeration systems, in the late 1920's through to the pre World War II years, a popular practice was to engineer multiple, commercial refrigeration, equipment applications, even those operating at different suction pressures, on a single condensing unit. 
A typical small application was a soda fountain, popular in drug stores and confectioneries in the period. Here the soda water [carbonated water] dispenser, syrup rail and refrigerated dry storage compartment are operated at a different temperature to the freezer section of the cabinet in which multiple flavours of ice cream were held.

##### Industrial Significance:
The marketing of refrigerated beverages, including beer and soda water, along with ice cream were major growth area in the period, spurred by the cultivated public interest in fresh new tastes made possible by innovative use mechanical refrigeration.

##### Socio-economic Significance:


##### Socio-cultural Significance:
Name brand refrigeration equipment manufacturers of the period [Frigidaire and Kelvinator] promoted fresh new tastes, often shamelessly, through the use of hyperbola in their advertising. For Canadians, particularly urban dwellers, emerging from the simple, sparse life of the late 19th and early 20th century were hungry for new taste sensations to break the monotony of daily existence. Ice cream and carbonated waters, mixed with sweet flavoured fruit syrups, the soda was the hit of the day.
The public tastes cultivated by the refrigeration industry would change forever the expectations of Canadians of the pleasures in store for them at home and at the corner store and confectionery.
