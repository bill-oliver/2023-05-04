##### Patent Date/Number:


##### Provenance:
From York County (York Region) Ontario, once a rich agricultural hinterlands, attracting early settlement in the last years of the 18th century. Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. 

This artifact was discovered in the 1950's in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, industrial and consumer technology.

##### Type and Design:
Configured around an innovative cat steel and steel channel base, with 3- ' ' steel pin legs, open belt drive without guard, demonstrates a lacl of awareness of public safety issues in the period

##### Industrial Significance:
The electric motor by Robbins Myers, Brampton Ont. Serves to further high light Brantford as the rapidly growing refrigeration capital of Canada.

##### Socio-economic Significance:
It serves to dramatise the rich array of engineering configurations and manufacturers, many short lived, all part of Canada's early developmental 'golden Age' of refrigeration technology, leading up to the 1950's. The Canadian consumer market for household technology had suddenly exploded

A Canadian trade journal, Radio Trade-Builder, reported in March 1935, 14 different manufacturers and 98 different models of household refrigerators for the Canadian home owner to chose from. It was an array of options that would be quickly reduced as competition in the market place took its toll.
